This program checks a given possible password and informs the user on the password's strength, based on a couple common criteria.
To run this program, download the repository ZIP, extract the folder, and launch the "PasswordChecker - Shortcut" file. This program is dependent on being run on a Windows 10 or above operating system with .NET 9.0 installed.
This tool is for educational use only and should not actually be used to determine the strength of a possible password.
Responsible use of this program does not include actually checking passwords you are considering using. Criteria used are incomplete in terms of creating a password unlikely to be hacked or brute-forced.
    How to run your program and any necessary dependencies.
    Clear warnings about its limitations (e.g., “This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information” - this will vary depending on your program).
    Ethical considerations and responsible use. In writing this, make sure to consider how your tool might be misused (e.g., Could someone modify it for malicious purposes? Does it give users a false sense of security? etc.).
