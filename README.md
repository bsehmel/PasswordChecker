This program checks a given possible password and informs the user on the password's strength, based on a couple common criteria.
To run this program, download the repository ZIP, extract the folder, and launch the "PasswordChecker - Shortcut" file. This program is dependent on being run on a Windows 10 or above operating system with .NET 9.0 installed.
This tool is for educational use only and should not actually be used to determine the strength of a possible password.
Responsible use of this program does not include actually checking passwords you are considering using. Criteria used are incomplete in terms of creating a password unlikely to be hacked or brute-forced.
